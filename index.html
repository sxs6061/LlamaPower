							<h2>Welcome to the world of Llama</h2>
							<p>The llama is a domesticated South American camelid, widely used as a meat and pack animal by Andean cultures since pre-Hispanic times. The name llama (in the past also spelled 'lama' or 'glama') was adopted by European settlers from native Peruvians. They are very social animals and live with other llamas as a herd. The wool produced by a llama is very soft and lanolin-free. Llamas are intelligent and can learn simple tasks after a few repetitions.When using a pack, they can carry about 25% to 30% of their body weight for 8–13 km (5–8 miles).</p>

						<h4>Did you know?</h4> 
						<p>A male llama is called as sire, the female is named as dam, and cria is the name given to baby llama. A group of llamas is called herd. Llamas are used for various purposes; such as, wool, packing, cart pulling, animal facilitated therapy, exhibitions, etc.<br><br> During the birth of a cria, the female llamas gather around the mother llama in order to protect it from male llamas and predators. Dams give birth in a standing position and the baby takes birth in 30 minutes only. Llamas can breed in three situations: harem breeding, field breeding, and hand breeding. Harem breeding involves leaving the male llamas with female llamas for most of the years; in case of field breeding, the female and male llamas are left in a field for some period of time; and in the hand breeding situation, the male and female llamas are bred, separated, and then rebred, until one of them refuses the breeding.<br><br> The female llama can take out only half inch of its tongue from the mouth and therefore it is not able to lick the baby, instead it nuzzles and hums on the newborns. Llamas have two-toed feet with leathery bottom which makes them excellent pack animals. Llamas are compared to dogs and horses because of their trustworthiness and capability to carry heavy loads. Most of the animals bite when agitated, but llamas spit. Yes, if anyone disturbs a llama then they spit on them.</p>

						<h4>PRE INCAN CULTURES..</h4> <p>The Moche people frequently placed llamas and llama parts in the burials of important people,  as offerings or provisions for the afterlife. The Moche culture of pre-Columbian Peru depicted llamas quite realistically in their ceramics.</p><br><br>
						<h4>INCAN EMPIRE..</h4> <p>In the Inca empire, llamas were the only beasts of burden, and many of the people dominated by the Inca had long traditions of llama herding. For the Inca nobility, the llama was of symbolic significance, and llama figures were often buried with the dead. In South America, llamas are still used as beasts of burden, as well as for the production of fiber and meat. The Inca deity Urcuchillay was depicted in the form of a multicolored llama. Scholar Alex Chepstow-Lusty has argued that the switch from a hunter-gatherer lifestyle to widespread agriculture was only possible because of the use of llama dung as fertilizer.</p><br><br>
						<h4>SPANISH EMPIRE..</h4> <p>One of the main uses for llamas at the time of the Spanish conquest was to bring down ore from the mines in the mountains. Gregory de Bolivar estimated that in his day, as many as 300 thousand were employed in the transport of produce from the Potosí mines alone, but since the introduction of horses, mules, and donkeys, the importance of the llama as a beast of burden has greatly diminished. According to Juan Ignacio Molina, the Dutch captain Joris van Spilbergen observed the use of chilihueques (possibly a llama type) by native Mapuches of Mocha Island as plow animals in 1614.</p>

						<h4>If Llama is your Animal Totem..</h4> <p>You have a very easy going personality and have a tendency to sacrifice your own lifestyle to accommodate others. You also tend to carry the weight of the world on your shoulders and have a strong connection to the environment and its subtle changes. If you are treated unfairly you tend to get somewhat stubborn and willful and make it clear that you are not pleased with the situation. You are generous in service to others and thrive in group settings although you often forget to serve yourself. You choose your friends carefully.</p><br><br>
						<h4>If Llama has come into your Dream..</h4> <p>To see a Llama in your dreams can represent the deep trust and faith you have in your own personal journey. Llama is symbolizing that you have the strength and endurance to reach your goal. Alternatively Llama could also be putting you on notice that you are worrying too much and carrying to large a load.</p>
